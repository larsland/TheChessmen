## JUnit testing with Gradle

In Android Studio, select Project, find the directory "tests", right click on "src", select "Run 'Tests in tests'"

Gradle does not send test events to Android Studio. Go to

    <path-to-repo>/TheChessmen/tests/build/reports/tests/index.html

in your web browser to see test coverage, stacktraces etc.
